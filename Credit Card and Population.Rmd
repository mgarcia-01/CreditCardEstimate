##### Update 07/27/2017
  RChunk in Getting Data with census API was hidden due to echo = FALSE. It is now visible. To run: obtain an API Key at https://www.census.gov/developers/ and store in local directory as file name = CensusAPIKEY and format csv, first row, first column. APIKEY Variable is set to read from this file and the local directory path.


## Setting Up Data {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### Getting Data with census API

```{r fetch Date,include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(RCurl)
library(data.table)
APIKEY <- fread(file.path(getwd(),paste("CensusAPIKEY",".csv",sep = "")), header = TRUE)
censusGEOURL <- paste0("https://api.census.gov/data/2016/pep/population?get=POP,DENSITY,GEONAME&for=state:*&key=",APIKEY)
censusAGEURL <- paste0("https://api.census.gov/data/2016/pep/natmonthly?get=POP,MONTHLY,AGE,GEONAME&for=us:*&key=",APIKEY)
rm(APIKEY)
```

### Parsing Data: Population and Geography


```{r  population,include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(jsonlite)
### this is to parse the census for us population by state, no age.
myjsoncensus <- jsonlite::fromJSON(txt = censusGEOURL)
uspop <- as.data.frame(myjsoncensus)
names(uspop) <- as.character(unlist(uspop[1,]))
uspop <- uspop[-1,]
uspop$POP <- as.numeric(as.character(uspop$POP))
uspop$DENSITY <- as.numeric(as.character(uspop$DENSITY))
```

### Parsing Data: Population,Month, and Age

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r age, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
### this is to parse the census for us population by age and month 
myjsoncensusAGE <- jsonlite::fromJSON(txt = censusAGEURL)
uspopAGE <- as.data.frame(myjsoncensusAGE)
names(uspopAGE) <- as.character(unlist(uspopAGE[1,]))
uspopAGE <- uspopAGE[-1,]
uspopAGE$POP <- as.numeric(as.character(uspopAGE$POP))
uspopAGE$AGE <- as.numeric(as.character(uspopAGE$AGE))
uspopAGE$MONTHLY <- as.numeric(as.character(uspopAGE$MONTHLY))
```

## Going Through Data {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### Population By Age for Dec 2016


Population seems uniform.

```{r Filter, include=TRUE,echo = TRUE}
#plot filtered to dec 2016
uspopAGEDist <- uspopAGE[which((uspopAGE$AGE <= 80) & (uspopAGE$AGE >= 1) & (uspopAGE$MONTHLY == 94)),]
plot(x=uspopAGEDist$AGE, y=(uspopAGEDist$POP/1000), type = "h", xlab = "AGE", ylab = "Population ('000s)")
```


### Pct Gains and Decline By Age

The changes in population fluctate between gains and losses plus or minus 5 percent, so the number that went from one age to another, is followed by a close figure to replace them. Keeping the number of populants in the early age category giving more of a uniform distribution to the entire us population and age


``` {r pctdiff, include= TRUE, echo=TRUE}
av <- zoo::zoo(uspopAGEDist$POP)
agelag <- as.data.frame(lag(av,k = -1, na.pad = TRUE))
names(agelag) <- c("agelagyr")

agelagcombined <-  as.data.frame(cbind(uspopAGEDist, agelag[1]))
agelagcombined_pct <-  as.data.frame(((agelagcombined$POP - agelagcombined$agelagyr)
                                      /agelagcombined$agelagyr)*100)
names(agelagcombined_pct) <- c("pct_chg")
agelagcombined <-  as.data.frame(cbind(agelagcombined, agelagcombined_pct[1]))
plot(agelagcombined$pct_chg, type = "o")
```

## Normal Distribution: Population Values {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### Setting Up Distributions
Using the values for one two and three standard deviations
Use either method to return population  value :

``` {r deviations, include= TRUE, echo = TRUE}
onedev <- .68*max(uspop$POP)
twodev <- .95*max(uspop$POP)
threedev <- .9967*max(uspop$POP)
```


* One Deviation : `r paste(onedev)`
* Two Deviation: `r paste(twodev)`
* Three Deviation: `r paste(twodev)`


or use this quickly built basic function and enter a value between 1 and 3:

``` {r fundev, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
QtyPopulationByDev <- function(no_deviations = 1){
  if(no_deviations == 1){devValue <- .68*max(uspop$POP)}
      else if(no_deviations == 2){devValue <- .95*max(uspop$POP)}
          else if(no_deviations == 3){devValue <- .9967*max(uspop$POP)}
  return(devValue)
}
```


So 2 deviations results in `r QtyPopulationByDev(no_deviations = 2)`

### Age range estimates per deviation: Normal Distribution

``` {r include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
#age range between 1 and 80 at 1 deviation
agemedian <- 80/2
AgeonedevLow <- (agemedian*(1-(.68/2)))
AgeonedevHigh <- (agemedian*(1+(.68/2)))
# normal distribution on 2 deviations. 95 percent
AgetwodevLow <- (agemedian*(1-(.95/2)))
AgetwodevHigh <- (agemedian*(1+(.95/2)))
#normal at 3 deviations, 99.7
AgethreedevLow <- (agemedian*(1-(.997/2)))
AgethreedevHigh <- (agemedian*(1+(.997/2)))
```

Using the source above:

* The population falls between `r paste(round(AgeonedevLow,0))`   and  `r paste(round(AgeonedevHigh,0))`  at 1 deviation
* The population falls between `r paste(round(AgetwodevLow,0))`   and  `r paste(round(AgetwodevHigh,0))`  at 2 deviations
* The population falls between `r paste(round(AgethreedevLow,0))`   and  `r paste(round(AgethreedevHigh,0))`  at 3 deviations


Based on a normal distribution, what amount of population do not have credit cards based on legal age to apply?


``` {r populationearlyage, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# normal distribution outside 95 percent that are cannot have credit cards
qty_Popul_earlyAge <- (((1-.95)/2)*sum(uspop$POP))
CensusEarlyAge <- sum(uspopAGEDist[which(uspopAGEDist$AGE >= 1 & uspopAGEDist$AGE <= 21),"POP"])
CensusAdultAge <- sum(uspopAGEDist[which(uspopAGEDist$AGE >= 21),"POP"])
Total_Number_CreditCards <- as.numeric(1895834000)                
Total_Number_CardHolders <- as.numeric(199800000)  
```

* `r paste(round(qty_Popul_earlyAge,0))` are left of the distribution outside of 2 deviations or 95 percent that do have credit cards.
* `r paste(round(CensusEarlyAge))` is the actual value that is given in the census data for December 2016
* `r paste(round(CensusEarlyAge - qty_Popul_earlyAge,0)) ` is a large difference, which makes sense looking at the trend that about 5 percent flow from one age bracket to another, and resulting in a uniform distribution as seen on the Census Chart (see Going Through Data graphs).

* `r paste(CensusAdultAge)` are probably eligble for a credit card. According to statistics brain (from source derived from FRBNY) there are `r paste(Total_Number_CreditCards)` number of credit cards and `r paste(Total_Number_CardHolders)` cardholders. Thats about `r paste(round(Total_Number_CreditCards/Total_Number_CardHolders,0))` credit cards per cardholder.
